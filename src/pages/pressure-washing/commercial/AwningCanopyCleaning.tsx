Awnings accumulate dirt, mold, bird droppings, and pollution that degrade materials and fade colors. Different materials require different approachesâ€”fabric needs gentle methods to avoid damage, while metal can handle more aggressive cleaning. Our technicians are trained to identify materials and apply appropriate techniques that restore appearance without causing harm."
